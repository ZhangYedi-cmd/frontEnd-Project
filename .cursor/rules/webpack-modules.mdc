# Webpack Configuration Guidelines

When working with webpack configurations in this project:

## Common Patterns

- Use `webpack()` function calls for programmatic configuration
- Include `path.resolve(__dirname, ...)` for output paths
- Use `contenthash` for cache busting: `filename: 'index.[contenthash].js'`
- Enable `clean: true` for output directory cleanup

## Performance Optimization

- Use `TerserPlugin` for minification
- Enable `BundleAnalyzerPlugin` for bundle size analysis
- Configure `usedExports: true` for tree shaking
- Use `thread-loader` for parallel processing

## Module-Specific Notes

- **build-volume/**: Focus on bundle analysis and size optimization
- **treeShaking/**: Demonstrates different tree shaking configurations
- **webpack-build-proformance/**: Shows Babel vs SWC performance comparison
- **code-spliting/**: Implements dynamic imports and chunk splitting

## Entry Points

Most modules use `./index.js` as the entry point. Check the specific module's `index.js` to understand what it demonstrates.
