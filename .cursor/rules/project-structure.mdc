# Frontend Engineering Learning Project Structure

This is a frontend engineering learning repository with multiple modules demonstrating different concepts.

## Main Directories

- **engineering/**: Core learning modules for frontend engineering concepts
- **mini-codes/**: Small utility examples and SSR implementations
- **node/**: Node.js code examples

## Engineering Modules

Each module in `engineering/` is self-contained with its own `package.json`:

- **build-volume/**: Webpack bundle analysis and optimization
- **bundless/**: Bundless development approaches
- **cjs&esm/**: CommonJS vs ES6 modules comparison
- **code-spliting/**: Webpack code splitting techniques
- **json-loader/**: Custom webpack loader implementation
- **rollup/**: Rollup bundler configuration
- **treeShaking/**: Dead code elimination examples
- **webpack-build-proformance/**: Build optimization techniques
- **webpack-runtime/**: Webpack runtime behavior

## Key Files

- [README.md](mdc:README.md) - Main project documentation
- Each module has a `build.js` for webpack configuration
- `package.json` files contain module-specific dependencies
- Entry points are typically `index.js` files
