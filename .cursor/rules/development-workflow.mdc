# Development Workflow

## Running Modules

Each engineering module is self-contained and can be run independently:

```bash
# Navigate to any module
cd engineering/build-volume

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Run the build script
node build.js
```

## File Organization

- **Entry Points**: Most modules use `index.js` as the main entry
- **Build Scripts**: `build.js` contains webpack configuration
- **Dependencies**: Each module has its own `package.json`
- **Output**: Generated files go to `dist/` directories

## Common Commands

- `node build.js` - Run webpack build
- `npm install` - Install module dependencies
- `npm run build` - If scripts are defined (rare in this project)

## Output Directories

- Most builds output to `dist/` subdirectories
- Bundle analyzer opens automatically in browser
- Check console output for build completion messages

## Debugging

- Check `package.json` for module type (commonjs/esm)
- Verify file paths in webpack configurations
- Look for error messages in console output
- Bundle analyzer helps visualize bundle contents

## Learning Tips

- Compare different module configurations side by side
- Check the generated `dist/` files to see webpack output
- Use browser dev tools to inspect loaded modules
- Experiment with different webpack optimization settings
